# titanic_eda

This project is an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The goal was to clean, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from the data regarding survival patterns, passenger demographics, and potential anomalies.

The analysis includes:
âœ… Data cleaning and handling missing values
âœ… Exploratory statistics on passengers (age, gender, fare, class, etc.)
âœ… Survival rate analysis by multiple factors (gender, class, embarkation point, age group)
âœ… Anomaly detection in fare prices across classes
âœ… Title extraction from passenger names for deeper demographic insights
âœ… Visualizations to highlight trends and distributions

Key Findings:
ðŸ“Œ Women and children had higher survival rates than men
ðŸ“Œ First-class passengers had a significantly higher chance of survival
ðŸ“Œ No strong correlation between fare price and survival probability
ðŸ“Œ Southampton was the most common embarkation point, but survival rates varied by port
ðŸ“Œ Some lower-class passengers paid fares higher than first-class passengers, indicating anomalies

ðŸ“Š Libraries used: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
